    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day, My Love <span class="heart">‚ù§</span></h1>

<p class="First">
    Every day with you is like a new chapter and if im being honest i don't remember what life felt like without your love probably just left like i was floating around in space but your love anchors me and keeps me going you're my safe space and just being with you makes my day quintillion times better, everybody wants to take a day out of 365/366 days to show love but baby im trying to add more days to the year so i can love you for longer. I dont want to ever think of what life will be without you cause it's always been you then and now and i cant wait to explore whatever the future¬†holds¬†for¬†us
